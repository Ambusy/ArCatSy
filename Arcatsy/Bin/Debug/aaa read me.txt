This is a Document and Object Archiving System.

It gives the archivist complete freedom over which collections will be together in one archive. 
Each collection will have it's own definition of which elements it will contain, independent of other collections.
Each collection will have multiple formats in which the data is shown or printed, formats may be shared with other collections.
Each collection exposes a number of terms with which information can be found using the search module. If 2 or more collections
use the same term, they may be found together while searching. Using a term while searching is optional.
Modules are available to create indexes or registers of the data from one or more collections together.
Data is entered or modified with the use of a generated data entry module, that is then completely programmable using the Rexx language.

The system is first used for the disclosure of the KDC archives, containing large and small archives by persons or organisations, 
a library, a photo and poster collection, newspaper clippings and a thesaurus, based on the AACR rules.

Download only the DOC folder, to see examples and possibilities, if you like.




By installing this application, you declare to accept the conditions in the LICENSE, included below.

To implement the archive cataloguing system you execute these steps: 

Unzip the package
The titles of fields in the database and some procedures in ReXX have a text in English, 
modify the source where necessary. 
Read the documentation (starting page is "Contents of the A R C A T documentation") in the installation folder, to get detailed information 
on how to customise the system: 
- Choose the type of database, you'll find empty databases for Access (mdb) and SQLite (db) 
  with collections prepared for a mail archiving system: incoming and outgoing mail and required interactions for them.
- Add fields in the definitions of the archive 
- Change the print layout of entities 
- Create own programs in Rexx, to incorporate into the system 
- Etc.
Connect any of sample databases to ODCB and name the database in the "system messages.txt" as indicated in the documentation.
The existing example, incoming and outgoing mail, can exist alongside your own archives, or can be deleted.
Feel free to experiment with it, and in the end, first delete the data and then delete or hide the definitions.

Use NewCollection.exe when you have a TMPL template collection from which you clone many real collections.
