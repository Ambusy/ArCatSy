<FONT SIZE=3>Searching</font>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>To search in the collection data, on the main menu
<p><IMG SRC="Menu4.jpg"><br> optionally select (<IMG SRC="spuviolet.jpg">)the
collection or collections (and use Ctrl-mouseclick to deselect a selected collection) 
and click on Search the index (<IMG SRC="spyellow.jpg">). 
<p>
The screen to enter the search criteria is presented to you<IMG SRC="Search1.jpg"><br>
 <br>
Enter the search criteria (<IMG SRC="spmascara.jpg">): 
<ul><li>Term: the word or phrase (stored in the search index) that the entity should or 
should not contain. 
<li>Type (optional): the index code that specifies the term more in detail as defined with the collection 
<li>Comparison = >= <= (optional): how to compare the index with the term given. 
The default is = (equal to). No distinction is made for upper or lower case letters. 
<li>Connector | ! & (optional): how to connect the various terms on different lines.  
<ul><li>| : this term OR the previous term must be found to select the entity 
<li>& : this term AND also the previous term must be found to select the entity  
<li>! : the previous term must be found but this one must be ABSENT to select the entity  
<br>The default is | : OR</ul>
<li>Starts with: Check this box, if you search all terms starting with the term given. 
<li>Contains: Check this box, if you search all terms that contain the term given in it's text. 
</ul> 
<br>A new line to enter one term is presented each time a previous is being used. 
<p>After having typed all criteria, click Search (<IMG SRC="spuviolet.jpg">) and you'll get
a message (<IMG SRC="spred.jpg">)indicating how many entities satisfy the criteria.  
<br>If you entered the search procedure with one or more collections selected on the main menu, these  
collection codes are written out on this screen (<IMG SRC="spblue.jpg">), 
and may still be erased or modified. 
<P>Normally you would now display the results found. But it is possible to save the resulting list of 
entities in a so called key-list, for re-use later clicking on Save results in a key-list 
(<IMG SRC="spviolet.jpg">). You might display the results again from the main
menu clicking on Print (<IMG SRC="spdgrey.jpg">) or order the list before the display
clicking on Sort a result list(<IMG SRC="splblue.jpg">) on the main menu. 
<br>To see the results, click on Show results (<IMG SRC="sprosa.jpg">). If you want to execute  
another search, close the window that shows the results, and you'll return to this window. 
Modify the criteria or start a complete new search by clicking New search (<IMG SRC="spbrown.jpg">) 
to start with a blank screen. 
<p>A last button: Predefined (<IMG SRC="spdgreen.jpg">)
may be clicked if visible, and it will present a list of 
standard queries to you, from which you may choose. It will bring you directly to the results 
if anything is found. To write a ReXX program that allows for standard queries,
see <A HREF="Userexits.htm#sq">Standard queries</A> for details. 
<p>When the user enters a term for a specific type of term (like a date), you may edit it before using 
it in a search to change it into a standard format.
See <A HREF="Userexits.htm#ed">Edit (standardize) query terms</A> for details.
