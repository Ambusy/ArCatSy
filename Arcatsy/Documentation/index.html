<P>ArCatSy has been designed primarily to catalogue collections in an
archive. But has been made such, that any type of information about
practically anything can be organised and made accessible by means of
ordered lists (or catalogues), by indices or registers and in online
queries.</P>
<P>There are 5 downloads available online:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An empty application, with the
	software and the instructions how to develop your own archiving
	system. <A HREF="Empty.zip">Download from here</A>

<P>You&rsquo;ll need to have installed Microsoft .Net runtime 4.0 or
higher, if you don&rsquo;t have Windows Vista or you&rsquo;ll get an
error message like &quot;mscorlib.dll not found&quot;.<BR>To install
it, go to the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>
website and search for: NET Framework x86 redistributable package</P>
<P>The free version uses Microsoft Jet (Access) as database engine. A
professional version for MySQL Server and ODBC is available on
request. Contact the author to know the cost and how to get the
download. 
</P>
<P>Due to the unexpected removal of MSJET software on the 64-bit
platform, you'll need an 32-bit pc to run. I have a 64-bit version,
not free, contact me for the download at ambusy [at] Gmail [dot] com</P>

<P>ArCatSy provides for:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Definition of the fields used in a
	collection, with the data entry order and indicators if programmable
	exits in Rexx are to be inserted in the processing 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Definition of the layout in which
	the data of collections is shown on the screen, when searching, or
	is printed on paper. The markup language is html, so flexibility is
	guaranteed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A data entry system, allowing for
	several different layouts for inserting the data. The data entry
	process is guided by a procedure written in the Rexx language, and
	the default Rexx data entry procedure is generated for you by the
	system. It only needs refinement to allow a smooth data entry, as
	nice as you want it. The procedure provides for a pure data entry
	with blank screens to start from and a correction mode on existing
	data that you select from a list, ordered according to your wishes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A table lookup system, for use in
	the data entry, to prepare lists of common used texts. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Searching through the data, with 1
	to 10 terms, in a &amp; | or ^ (and, or, not) context. Possibility
	to limit the search in specific collections. Available search terms
	are based on extracting pieces of search terms from a text field by
	using regular expressions, as defined by Microsoft for the .Net
	programming environment. Most useful examples are included in the
	documentation of ArCatSy. You might define every field to be
	searched by on every word. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Indices or registers on the
	information of one or more collections, you choose which field(s) to
	use as source, and what regular expression to use to extract terms
	from that source. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ordering results of a search on
	any number of fields in a collection and print the resulting ordered
	list. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Translation of the package in any
	language. All literal texts are stored in one text file. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Maintenance procedures, for import and export of data and
	definitions, and what else is needed to make the system function
	well.</P>

<P>Use of this software is freeware, without charge, if you accept
