<BODY>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>Start implementing a cataloguing system by first examining which are the various collections 
in the archives. </P>
<P>In the sample I gathered data about my music archive. On CD, CD-ROM, tape and record. I distinguish 4 collections. Because the details are very different between them, or because I want to distinguish in indices or in print. I have 45 rpm singles plays from one artist, long plays from one artist, samplers with various artists and classical music with special characteristics  like composer, director, orchestra etc.</P>
<P>So first decide about the collections, looking at the characteristics for each different type of entity.</P>

<P>Once made a sort of layout, start inserting the definitions.</P>

<P>Run ARCAT.exe</P>
<P>Choose <IMG SRC="spot1.jpg">&quot;Maintenance&quot; </p>
<IMG SRC="Menu1.jpg">
<P>and then <IMG SRC="spot2.jpg">&quot;Collections&quot;:</P>
<IMG SRC="Maintenance1.jpg">
<P>and you'll be presented the grid to insert or modify or delete collections, as explained in the 
next chapter.
<P>In general, when you are presented a grid, you act upon it as in Excel: one click selects a cell and when you type, it will replace the existing text in the cell. Another single click in a selected cel selects the text, allowing to modify parts of it. 
A click on the empty cell at the beginning of the row, selects the complete row and the Canc-key deletes the row.
A click on the last (empty) row inserts a new row in the grid, and you may fill in the cells as above.
The little arrow head indicates the active row. If you click on the empty last row in the lower grid, the key from the active row in the grid above will be filled in automatically.
An asterisk indicates that this is the row to insert a new row of data.</P>
