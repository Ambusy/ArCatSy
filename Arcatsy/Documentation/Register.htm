<FONT SIZE=3>List entities in a Register or an Index</font>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>A register (or an index) lists all entities of one or more collections
ordered by an identicative element (or several elements) from each entity, ordered by 
this element. An entity thus appears as many times as elements are extracted from it. 
<br>To create and display a register, on the main menu 
<br><IMG SRC="Menu4.jpg"><br>  
click on Create a register (<IMG SRC="spviolet.jpg">)
<P>
On the register screen,<br><IMG SRC="Register1.jpg"><br>   
you'll have to enter a lot of data, to create the register. 
Fortunately there is a procedure to specify a list of standard registers and you  
may choose one of them with de Predefined (<IMG SRC="spdgreen.jpg">) button. If no predefined 
registers are prepared, the button does not show. See <A HREF="Userexits.htm#sr">Standard register </A> 
about details how to create predefined registers.
<p>To create a register from scratch, you need to enter these data: 
<ul><li>Choose between extraction of register element(s) with  
<ul><li><A HREF="Regular expressions.htm">Regular expressions </A> and you furnish the expression 
(<IMG SRC="spblue.jpg">).
Often used expressions are: 
<ul><li>\w* to extract each word from the text in the field of the entity as a register term
<li>\d* to extract each number from the text  
<li>.* to consider the whole text as one term</ul> 
<li>A ReXX program named Register.rex(<IMG SRC="spdgrey.jpg">).   
Details on how to write a program to extract terms from a field's text are found in
<A HREF="Userexits.htm#ri">Registers and query indexing</A>. 
</ul> 
<li>Uncheck the box (<IMG SRC="spdviolet.jpg">)for converting to lowercase, if terms written differently are to be considered 
unequal.
<li>Name the file (<IMG SRC="spblue2.jpg">) that will contain the keylist, resulting from the creation. 
The list may be re-used to print the register again, without re-creating it. 
<li>Open the list (<IMG SRC="sprosa.jpg">)for each collection, that you want to include in the register 
and check each field(<IMG SRC="spbrown.jpg">), that is to be examined with the regular expression or with the ReXX program, 
to furnish terms for the register. 
</ul> 
You may now create the register(<IMG SRC="spyellow.jpg">)<p> 
<br><IMG SRC="Register2.jpg"><br>To view the register click Print(<IMG SRC="spyellow.jpg">)     
to find yourself on the already known screen to display data. Choose a layout suitable
for a register, otherwise you'll not get the extracted terms. A suitable layout might be: <p>
<IMG SRC="Layout2.jpg"> <br> that shows the collection code once, each internal sequence number
the artist and the title.<br><IMG SRC="Register3.jpg"><p>
