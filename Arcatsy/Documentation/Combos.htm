<FONT SIZE=2><p>Suppose I'd like to add the record label in the data for my 45 Rpm records.
In the definition (as described in the <A HREF="Define collection.htm">define</A> 
procedure) I add a line (<IMG SRC="spyellow.jpg">) like this: <p><IMG SRC="Combo1.jpg">
<p>where I specify, that labels may be chosen from a combolist named Label. 
<p>To create the Label list, go to the maintenance screen <IMG SRC="Maintenance3.jpg">
<br>and choose Combos (<IMG SRC="sporange.jpg">).
<IMG SRC="Combo2.jpg"><p>You'll find the name of the list in the upper grid 
(<IMG SRC="spot1.jpg">), and you'll only have to select it
and in the lower grid (<IMG SRC="spot2.jpg">) fill in the names in the list in the colunm 
CmbText and order these names specifying a appropriate number in the column CmbOrder. 
<p>If, after you <A HREF="Generate rexx.htm">generated</A> the new Rexx program for data entry, you start entering data, 
you'll get this picture,<br><IMG SRC="Combo3.jpg"> 
<br>showing the new data field, as it appears when opened with a mouse click. 
You choose with a mouseclick, or enter a different name if what you need is not in the list.
