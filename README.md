This is a Document and Object Archiving and Retrieval System.

It gives the archivist complete freedom over which collections will be together in one archive. 
Each collection will have it's own definition of which elements it will contain, independent of other collections.
Each collection will have multiple formats in which the data is shown or printed, formats may be shared with other collections.
Each collection exposes a number of terms with which information can be found using the search module. If 2 or more collections
use the same term, they may be found together while searching. Using a term while searching is optional.
Modules are available to create indexes or registers of the data from one or more collections together.
Data is entered or modified with the use of a generated data entry module, that is then completely programmable using the Rexx language.

The system is first used for the disclosure of the KDC archives, containing large and small archives by persons or organisations, 
a library, a photo and poster collection, newspaper clippings and a thesaurus, based on the AACR rules.
